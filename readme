Since the desire was to check for the ledger data frequently I 
scheduled it outside of infosphere/director.  You can still see
the job log from director but scheduling is done thru cron.

Shell 'runProdFromCron.sh' kicks off the exec 'execute_dstagejob.sh'
with parms of '-start' and properties file of 'revlw_ip0.properties'.
I used this shell to make it easier... in cron just schedule this exec,
if you need to change properties etc... just change the exec.

Note I'd setup cron with following:
00,15,30,45 9-18 * * 1-5 /opt/IBM/InformationServer/Server/Projects/live/runProdFromCron.sh

This says to run the exec Monday thru Friday (1-5), between hours of 9am-6pm (9-18) and every 15 minutes (at: 00,15,30,45)

The runProdFromCron shell uses property file revlw_ip0.properties, that file
has all of the parameters for the job.  You'll need to update this file when
the password on VM changes... should be obvious (do the change with vi, if
need help ask :))

Note: under the sandbox-media3 folder on ralbz001027 are property files for the other systems, if you want to test make the appropriate change there... I only
tested from that folder since didn't make sense to put schedule a cron job
from any other repository.
